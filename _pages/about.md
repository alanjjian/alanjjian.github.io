Hi there! I'm a 5th-year Masters student in Data Science at UC Berkeley. My primary interests lay in applied ML/NLP and Bayesian Statistics.

In just the past year, I've had the chance to work on a number of exciting projects, including the deployment of a [fine-tuned RetinaNet model to automate the counting of elephant seals](https://github.com/alanjjian/mids-251-elephant-seal) at Point Reyes and a slightly more whimsical attempt to [use BART to create two-sentence horror stories](https://github.com/alanjjian/w207-two-sentence-horror) based on [r/TwoSentenceHorror](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoSentenceHorror/).

I've also had the opportunity to TA for the very classes that inspired me to become a data scientist at UC Berkeley, including Data 100, 102, and Data 104. You can read more about those on my [teaching page](alanjjian.github.io/teaching/).

During my undergraduate (which I also spent at Berkeley), I had the chance to work with Prof. Sara Beckman and Prof. Kosa Goucher-Lambert to study goal formation on student teams using NLP techniques. You can read all about our findings in our [conference paper](https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/proceedings-abstract/IDETC-CIE2021/85406/V004T04A005/1128089?redirectedFrom=PDF).

Outside of work, you'll either find me out on the courts playing tennis with friends (always looking for more partners!) or at home playing video games. 

If you're interested in connecting, feel free to reach out to me via LinkedIn, or shoot me an email!
